"""Architecture guard for api-sentinel-scheduler: this repo may only depend on what its layout allows.

Repos are separate, so each one tests ITS OWN package; nothing here relies on sibling checkouts.
Cross-repo version compatibility is checked by a separate integration workflow.

Rules for package ``sentinel_scheduler``:
  - imports no other service package (in particular never server.*, the API).
